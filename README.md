This is my first place programming submission for Ubisoft Toronto NEXT 2022.
The challenge this year was to make a game in C++ based off Atari's 1982 [Gravitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitar).

My game is lovingly titled _Vanguard Mission Zero: Genesis Odyssey_.
Check out the [gameplay video](https://youtu.be/N88Oq19CvQY).
